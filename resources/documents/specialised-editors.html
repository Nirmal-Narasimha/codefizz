                <h4>Specialised Editors</h4>
                <p>Some editors include special features and extra functions, for instance,</p>
                <p>Source code editors are text editors with additional functionality to facilitate the production of source 
                    code. These often feature user-programmable syntax highlighting and code navigation functions as well as 
                    coding tools or keyboard macros similar to an HTML editor.</p>
                <p>Folding editors. This subclass includes so-called "orthodox editors" that are derivatives of Xedit. 
                    Editors that implement folding without programing-specific features are usually called outliners.</p>
                <p>IDEs (integrated development environments) are designed to manage and streamline large programming 
                    projects. They are usually only used for programming as they contain many features unnecessary for simple 
                    text editing.</p>
                <p>World Wide Web authors are offered a variety of HTML editors dedicated to the task of creating web pages. 
                    These include: Dreamweaver, KompoZer and E Text Editor. Many offer the option of viewing a work in 
                    progress on a built-in HTML rendering engine or standard web browser.</p>
                <p>Most web development is done in a dynamic programming language such as Ruby or PHP using a source code 
                    editor or IDE. The HTML delivered by all but the simplest static web sites is stored as individual 
                    template files that are assembled by the software controlling the site and do not compose a complete 
                    HTML document.</p>
                <p>Mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists often produce articles and books using TeX or 
                    LaTeX in plain text files. Such documents are often produced by a standard text editor, but some 
                    people use specialized TeX editors.</p>
                <p>Outliners. Also called tree-based editors, because they combine a hierarchical outline tree with 
                    a text editor. Folding (see above) can be considered a specialized form of outlining.</p>

                <p>Distraction-free editors provide a minimalistic interface with the purpose of isolating the writer 
                    from the rest of the applications and operating system, thus being able to focus on the writing 
                    without distractions from interface elements like a toolbar or notification area.</p>
                <p>Programmable editors can usually be enhanced to perform any or all of these functions, 
                    but simpler editors focus on just one, or, like gPHPedit, are targeted at a single programming language.</p>
