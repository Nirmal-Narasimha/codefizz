                <h4>What is a text editor&quest;</h4>
                <p>A text editor is a type of computer program that edits plain text. Such programs are sometimes known as 
                    "notepad" software, following the naming of Microsoft Notepad. Text editors are provided with 
                    operating systems and software development packages, and can be used to change files such as configuration 
                    files, documentation files and programming language source code.
                </p>
                <p>Plain text exclusively consists of character representation. Each character is represented by a fixed-length 
                    sequence of one, two, or four bytes, or as a variable-length sequence of one to four bytes, in accordance 
                    to specific character encoding conventions, such as ASCII, ISO/IEC 2022, UTF-8, or Unicode. These 
                    conventions define many printable characters, but also non-printing characters that control the flow of 
                    the text, such space, line break, and page break. Plain text contains no other information about the text 
                    itself, not even the character encoding convention employed. Plain text is stored in text files, although 
                    text files do not exclusively store plain text. In the early days of computers, plain text was displayed 
                    using a monospace font, such that horizontal alignment and columnar formatting were sometimes done using 
                    whitespace characters. For compatibility reasons, this tradition has not changed.
                </p>
                <p>Rich text, on the other hand, may contain metadata, character formatting data (e.g. typeface, size, weight 
                    and style), paragraph formatting data (e.g. indentation, alignment, letter and word distribution, and 
                    space between lines or other paragraphs), and page specification data (e.g. size, margin and reading 
                    direction). Rich text can be very complex. Rich text can be saved in binary format (e.g. DOC), text 
                    files adhering to a markup language (e.g. RTF or HTML), or in a hybrid form of both (e.g. Office Open XML).
                </p>
                <p>Text editors are intended to open and save text files containing either plain text or anything that can be 
                    interpreted as plain text, including the markup for rich text or the markup for something else (e.g. SVG).
                </p>
                <p>Before text editors existed, computer text was punched into cards with keypunch machines. Physical boxes 
                    of these thin cardboard cards were then inserted into a card-reader. Magnetic tape and disk "card-image" files 
                    created from such card decks often had no line-separation characters at all, and assumed fixed-length 
                    80-character records. An alternative to cards was punched paper tape. It could be created by some teleprinters 
                    (such as the Teletype), which used special characters to indicate ends of records.
                </p>
                <p>The first text editors were "line editors" oriented to teleprinter- or typewriter-style terminals without 
                displays. Commands (often a single keystroke) effected edits to a file at an imaginary insertion point called 
                the "cursor". Edits were verified by typing a command to print a small section of the file, and periodically 
                by printing the entire file. In some line editors, the cursor could be moved by commands that specified the 
                line number in the file, text strings (context) for which to search, and eventually regular expressions. Line 
                editors were major improvements over keypunching. Some line editors could be used by keypunch; editing commands 
                could be taken from a deck of cards and applied to a specified file. Some common line editors supported a 
                "verify" mode in which change commands displayed the altered lines.</p>

                <p>When computer terminals with video screens became available, screen-based text editors (sometimes called just 
                "screen editors") became common. One of the earliest full-screen editors was O26, which was written for the 
                operator console of the CDC 6000 series computers in 1967. Another early full-screen editor was vi. Written 
                in the 1970s, it is still a standard editor on Unix and Linux operating systems. Also written in the 1970s 
                was the UCSD Pascal Screen Oriented Editor, which was optimized both for indented source code as well as 
                general text. Emacs, one of the first free and open source software projects, is another early full-screen 
                or real-time editor, one that was ported to many systems. A full-screen editor's ease-of-use and speed 
                (compared to the line-based editors) motivated many early purchases of video terminals.</p>
                
                <p>The core data structure in a text editor is the one that manages the string (sequence of characters) or list 
                of records that represents the current state of the file being edited. While the former could be stored in a 
                single long consecutive array of characters, the desire for text editors that could more quickly insert text, 
                delete text, and undo/redo previous edits led to the development of more complicated sequence data structures. 
                A typical text editor uses a gap buffer, a linked list of lines (as in PaperClip), a piece table, or a rope, 
                as its sequence data structure.</p>

                <p>Some text editors are small and simple, while others offer broad and complex functions. For example, Unix 
                and Unix-like operating systems have the pico editor (or a variant), but many also include the vi and Emacs 
                editors. Microsoft Windows systems come with the simple Notepad, though many people—especially programmers—prefer 
                other editors with more features. Under Apple Macintosh's classic Mac OS there was the native SimpleText, which 
                was replaced in Mac OS X by TextEdit, which combines features of a text editor with those typical of a word 
                processor such as rulers, margins and multiple font selection. These features are not available simultaneously, 
                but must be switched by user command, or through the program automatically determining the file type.
