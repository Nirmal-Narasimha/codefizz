                <h4>Features of Codefizz</h4>
                <p>Find and replace – Text editors provide extensive facilities for searching and replacing text, either on groups of files 
                    or interactively. Advanced editors can use regular expressions to search and edit text or code.</p>
                <p>Cut, copy, and paste – most text editors provide methods to duplicate and move text within the file, or between files.</p>
                <p>Ability to handle UTF-8 encoded text.</p>
                <p>Text formatting – Text editors often provide basic visual formatting features like line wrap, auto-indentation, bullet 
                    list formatting using ASCII characters, comment formatting, syntax highlighting and so on. These are typically only for 
                    display and do not insert formatting codes into the file itself.</p>
                <p>Undo and redo – As with word processors, text editors provide a way to undo and redo the last edit, or more. 
                    Often—especially with older text editors—there is only one level of edit history remembered and successively issuing 
                    the undo command will only "toggle" the last change. Modern or more complex editors usually provide a multiple-level 
                    history such that issuing the undo command repeatedly will revert the document to successively older edits. A separate 
                    redo command will cycle the edits "forward" toward the most recent changes. The number of changes remembered depends 
                    upon the editor and is often configurable by the user.</p>
                <p>Macro or procedure definition: to define new commands or features as combinations of prior commands or other macros, 
                    perhaps with passed parameters, or with nesting of macros.</p>
                <p>Multi-file editing: the ability to edit multiple files during an edit-session, perhaps remembering the current-line 
                    cursor of each file, to insert repeated text into each file, copy or move text among files, compare files side-by-side 
                    (perhaps with a tiled multiple-document interface), etc.</p>
                <p>Multi-view editors: the ability to display multiple views of the same file, with independent cursor tracking, 
                    synchronizing changes among the windows but providing the same facilities as are available for independent files.</p>
                <p>Collapse/expand: The ability to temporarlly exclude sections of the text from view. This may either be based on a 
                    range of line numbers or on some syntactic element, e.g., excluding everything between a BEGIN; and the matching END;.</p>
                <p>Column-based editing; the ability to alter or insert data at a particular column, or to shift data to specific columns.</p>
                <p>Data transformation – Reading or merging the contents of another text file into the file currently being edited. Some 
                    text editors provide a way to insert the output of a command issued to the operating system's shell. Also, a 
                    case-shifting feature could translate to lowercase or uppercase.</p>
                <p>Filtering – Some advanced text editors allow the editor to send all or sections of the file being edited to another 
                    utility and read the result back into the file in place of the lines being "filtered". This, for example, is useful 
                    for sorting a series of lines alphabetically or numerically, doing mathematical computations, indenting source code, 
                    and so on.</p>
                <p>Syntax highlighting – contextually highlights source code, markup languages, config files and other text that appears 
                    in an organized or predictable format. Editors generally allow users to customize the colors or styles used for each 
                    language element. Some text editors also allow users to install and use themes to change the look and feel of the 
                    editor's entire user interface.</p>
                <p>Extensibility - a text editor intended for use by programmers must provide some plugin mechanism, or be scriptable, 
                    so a programmer can customize the editor with features needed to manage individual software projects, customize 
                    functionality or key bindings for specific programming languages or version control systems, or conform to specific 
                    coding styles.</p>
